# hello-world-go-pq

This repo has a "Hello World" Go application that uses the [pq driver](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq) to talk to [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/).

To run the code:

1. Start a [local, insecure CockroachDB cluster](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster.html).

2. Create a `bank` database and `maxroach` user as described in [Build a Go app with CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-go-app-with-cockroachdb-gorm.html#insecure).

3. From the [SQL client](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/cockroach-sql.html): `GRANT ALL ON DATABASE bank TO maxroach`

4. In your terminal, from this directory: `go run main.go`
